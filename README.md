# rm2-scripts

This repo is where I'm storing the scripts that I write for working with the [reMarkable tablet](https://remarkable.com/).

Each script is in its own directory, and each directory has its own `README.md` file which talks about that script.

## Licenses

Each script is covered by its own license, as explained in that script's `README.md` file. They're all open source - I *think* they're all MIT, but there might be one or two which are GPLv2 or GPLv3. See the `README.md` file in each directory, or the copyright notice within each script, for details.

# Focus Notes

The `rm2-template-focus-notes` shell script uses [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/)'s `magick` command to create a simple `.png` template which looks like the "Focus Notes" layout, illustrated in the attachment to [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemarkableTablet/comments/16iyq60/focus_notes_template/).

I wrote this after seeing [this question](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemarkableTablet/comments/16iyq60/focus_notes_template/) on Reddit. I thought it sounded like something really simple, and ... turns out I was right.
